User Input: Who is the sender?
AI Response: As you're checking your morning emails, a new message catches your attention. It's from an unknown sender, and the subject line reads "URGENT: Account Verification Required". You open the email to find the following message:

From: Unknown
Subject: URGENT: Account Verification Required

Your account will be suspended unless you verify your login credentials immediately. Please click the link below to verify your account and prevent suspension.

There's a link at the bottom of the email, but it doesn't seem to be associated with any of the usual company websites. What do you want to do with this email? Do you want to click the link, reply to the sender, or maybe forward it to someone else for assistance?

User Input: I hover over the sender's address and wait
AI Response: The sender's address reveals a generic "noreply@company.com" domain. It doesn't look too suspicious, but it's also not something you'd expect from a legitimate email from your company. The IT manager, John, walks over to your desk, eyeing the email on your screen. "What's going on here?" he asks, his brow furrowed with concern.

You fill him in on the email, and John nods thoughtfully. "Good catch on the sender's address," he says. "That's a classic phishing tactic. We've seen it before." He leans in, his voice taking on a more serious tone. "Let's take a closer look at the email's content. Can you click on the link and see where it takes us?"

User Input: What is the email address of the sender?
AI Response: John leans in, squinting at the email on your screen. "The sender's address is 'noreply@company.com'. That's not a standard email address for our company, is it?" He raises an eyebrow, clearly concerned. "We usually have a specific email address for account verification notifications. This looks like it might be a phishing attempt."

John's expression turns serious. "We need to be careful with this one. If it's a phishing email, clicking on any links or providing sensitive information could compromise our entire system. I'll need to investigate further and see if I can find any information on who sent this email." He starts typing away on his computer, trying to track down the source of the suspicious email.
