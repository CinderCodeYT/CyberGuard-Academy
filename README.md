- **Poor knowledge retention**: Employees forget approximately 70% of training content within 24 hours and up to 80% within a month if not reinforced (Source: [Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4492928/), verified by [Hornetsecurity 2024, Brightside AI 2025](https://www.hornetsecurity.com/en/blog/why-cyber-awareness-training-is-an-ongoing-process/))

- **Low effectiveness**: Traditional passive training achieves only 20% retention compared to 75% for active, engaging learning (Source: [Terranova Security 2024](https://www.terranovasecurity.com/resources/guides/gamification-for-cybersecurity-awareness-training-success))

- **Human error remains primary risk**: 68% of data breaches involve human error, with 91% of cyberattacks starting with phishing emails (Source: [Verizon DBIR via JumpCloud 2025, MetaCompliance 2025](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/Tea/reports/2025-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf))
